# Surfs Up Weather Analysis
## Project Overview
This project was created to analyze weather patterns in Hawaii in order to help decide whether or not to open a surf and icecream shop. The project focus was on June and December, looking at tempurature and rainfall to determine if the weather statistics were optimal for the store to be successful enough to operate.

## Results
#### June temperature statistics:

#### December temperature statistics:

#### Key takeaways:
1) Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees with a standard deviation around 3. This means that the weather is very ideal with very little flucuation.
2) the max temperature for June is 85 and for December is 83, which is very similar. 
3) the min temperature for June is 64 and 56 for December, which is not as close as the max, but the 75 percentile is 77 (June) and 74 (December), so it's likely that tempuratures below 60 would be rare.

## Summary:
In summary I would recommend that the investment is safe. The weather in December and June are very similar. December has a wider range of results and the extreme cold could be considered not suitable for the shop to remain open. From this analysis and the statistics, the December extreme low temps should be rare enough to not impact overall project economics.  

Additional queries thatrecipation difference between June and December to determine if one has more rain than the other. Additionally, you could compare the results by weather station to see if there is an area on the island prone to more favorable weather.
